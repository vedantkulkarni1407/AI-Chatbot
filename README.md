AI Chatbot Project
Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that leverages Google's Gemini API to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and can be easily integrated into various applications. The project utilizes Gradio and Streamlit for creating interactive web interfaces, making it accessible and easy to use for both developers and end-users.

The chatbot is capable of handling a wide range of queries, from general knowledge questions to more complex conversational interactions. The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy customization and extension.

Key Features
Gemini API Integration: The chatbot uses Google's Gemini API to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.

Interactive Web Interface: The project includes two different web interfaces built using Gradio and Streamlit.

Customizable: The chatbot can be easily customized to suit specific use cases or industries.

User-Friendly: The interfaces are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical users.

Components Used
1. Gemini API
Purpose: The core of the chatbot, responsible for generating responses to user queries.

Integration: The API is integrated into the project using Python's requests library or any other suitable HTTP client.

Key Features:

Context-aware responses.

Support for multiple languages.

High accuracy and relevance in responses.

2. Gradio
Purpose: Used to create a simple and interactive web interface for the chatbot.

Integration: Gradio is used to build a web-based interface where users can input their queries and receive responses in real-time.

Key Features:

Easy to set up and use.

Supports real-time interaction.

Customizable UI components.

3. Streamlit
Purpose: Another web interface option, providing a more customizable and feature-rich experience compared to Gradio.

Integration: Streamlit is used to create a more advanced web interface with additional features like session management, data visualization, and more.

Key Features:

Highly customizable.

Supports complex layouts and interactions.

Ideal for building data-driven applications.

4. Python
Purpose: The primary programming language used to develop the chatbot.

Key Libraries:

requests: For making HTTP requests to the Gemini API.

gradio: For building the Gradio interface.

streamlit: For building the Streamlit interface.

os and dotenv: For managing environment variables, such as API keys.

5. Environment Management
Purpose: To manage API keys and other sensitive information securely.

Tools:

.env file: Used to store environment variables like the Gemini API key.

python-dotenv: A Python library used to load environment variables from the .env file.

6. Version Control
Purpose: To manage and track changes in the project.

Tool: Git is used for version control, and the project is hosted on GitHub for easy collaboration and sharing.

Acknowledgments
Google: For providing the Gemini API.

Gradio and Streamlit: For their excellent libraries that make building web interfaces a breeze.
